# Features
The table was designed to be *extremely flexible and light*; it doesn't make any assumptions about your data or how you: filter, sort or page it. That said, we wanted to keep the features strictly related to dealing with the data rather than implementing complex filtering/etc that is often very use-case specific. The current features include:

- Light codebase / No external dependencies
- Expressive Column Templates
- Column Reordering & Resizing
- Client/Server Pagination & Sorting
- Intelligent Column Width Algorithms ( Force-fill & Flex-grow )
- Integrated Pager
- Row Selection ( Single & Multi )
- Fixed AND Fluid height
- Decoupled theme'ing with included Google Material theme

### Roadmap
We are really excited about the table and wanted to get it out into the open as quickly as possible so we had to delay some of the features but we plan to add the following:

- Horizontal Scrolling
- Touch selection support
- Handle large data sets ( Virtual DOM )
- Virtual Paging
- Left and Right Column Pinning
- Rich Header Templates
- Checkbox Selection
- Tree Grids
- Row Grouping
